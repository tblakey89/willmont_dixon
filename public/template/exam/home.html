					<p>Welcome to Willmott Dixon's Pre-Enrolment.</p>
					<p>Completing this online register provides you with the safety knowledge neccessary for you to operate on sites.</p>
					<p>You will need your CSCS card and a headshot photograph you can upload.</p>
					<p>Registering on this system and completing the online test every 12 months will allow you to work on all our sites.</p>
					<p>This system replaces the health and safety induction you would normally sit when arriving onto every new site. This means you can now get to work after just a short site specific induction.</p>

					<form class="form-inline">
						<input type="password" class="input-large" placeholder="Password" ng-model="password">
						<button type="submit" class="btn" ng-click="signIn()">Enter Site</button>
						<span class="help-inline red">{{error.password}}</span>
